                Shri. S. V. Iyer and Dr. V. Mangalam, an elderly couple, started Sivananda Saraswathi Sevashram in 1945 with just 3 kids and with the blessings of Swami Sivananda of Rishikesh. More popularly known as "Sivananda Ashram/Orphanage/Gurukulam", the organization has grown to be a very well known and well recognized social institution in the country today.

                We are a "National Awardee" institution awarded by the Government of India in 1983.

                Sivananda Saraswathi Sevashram is a non-profit organization with the primary objective of protecting orphans, destitute women, the physically handicapped, AIDS-affected children, and the elderly.

                With the experience of more than 70 years of recorded services to thousands of poor orphans, Sivananda Orphanage effectively helps transform/grow these orphans to productive citizens. We not only provide food, education and shelter, but also instill character and morals to help them grow, learn and eventually become independent.

                Many, including former Prime Minister of India, Shri Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, former President of India Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam have visited our ashram and witnessed our committed work. We currently look after 300 children and 80 elderly, all of whom are accepted and cared for with love and affection.
